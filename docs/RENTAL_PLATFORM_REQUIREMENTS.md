# Rental Platform Requirements (Must-Have + Next)

Use this as a roadmap for room/apartment rental features.

## Must-Have

### Listings + Discovery (if users browse/select rooms)
- Public listing pages (SEO-friendly)
- Search + filters (location, price, amenities, availability, rules)
- Room availability calendar (per room + per property)
- Photos/media gallery (upload, ordering, cover photo)
- Map view + nearby places (optional)

### Booking / Application Flow
Pick one model (or support both):
- **Booking model**: request-to-book / instant book, approval workflow
- **Leasing model**: apply -> screening -> approve -> sign lease -> pay deposit/first month

Likely required beyond contracts/invoices/payments:
- Application form builder (per tenant/property)
- Lead pipeline stages (new -> contacted -> toured -> applied -> approved/rejected)
- Tour scheduling / visit appointments
- Offer letter / pre-lease steps

### Pricing & Promotions
- Rent pricing rules: base rent + premiums (floor, view, furnished, short-term)
- Security deposit rules
- Proration logic (move-in mid-month)
- Discounts / promo codes / vouchers
- Late fees + grace periods

### Document Management
- E-signatures for leases (DocuSign/HelloSign or built-in)
- ID uploads, proof of income, attachments
- Document templates per tenant/property

## Operational Features (Complete the Flow)

### Move-in / Move-out Lifecycle
- Move-in checklist (inspection, inventory, photos)
- Move-out notice + end date workflow
- Deposit deductions & settlement statement
- Room condition reports

### Messaging
- In-app messaging threads (tenant <-> property staff)
- Email/SMS/WhatsApp routing (optional)
- Message history linked to lease/unit/request

### Accounting / Finance (Lightweight)
- Payouts/reconciliation (when money hits bank)
- Owner statements (if multi-owner properties)
- Expense tracking (maintenance costs)
- Export to accounting (QuickBooks/Xero) or CSV reports

### Compliance & Policies
- House rules per property/room type
- Privacy/consent (ID storage, retention)
- Local tax support (if short-term/nightly)

## Advanced Modules (Nice-to-Have)

### Tenant Screening Integrations
- Credit/background checks (region-dependent)
- Fraud checks / identity verification

### Channel + Marketing Integrations
- Listing syndication (Facebook Marketplace, etc.)
- UTM/lead source tracking + campaign performance

### Smart Access / IoT Depth
- Time-based access schedules (move-in window, staff shifts)
- Offline access fallback (PIN codes)
- Vendor access (maintenance staff limited-time entry)

### Analytics Dashboards
- Occupancy rate, vacancy days
- Revenue per room / per property
- Collection rate, delinquency
- Maintenance SLA, turnaround time
- Cohort retention (for co-living)

### Multilingual + Multi-Currency
- Local language support
- Currency + tax rules per tenant/location
